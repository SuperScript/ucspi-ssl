== NAME
sslperl - A preforking ssl server using embedded Perl

== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
sslperl _opts_ _file_ _prog_
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION
The +sslperl+ program is preforks servers listening for SSL client connections.
For each such connection it receives, it executes the subroutine and arguments
given in _prog_ from Perl code in the file +_file_+.

The +sslperl+ program forks the requested number of children, each listening
for TCP client connections.  Before handling any requests, each child parses and
runs the perl code in +_file_+.  The file should end with a true expression,
like a module.

To handle a request, a child process executes +_prog_+ as a perl
subroutine, with file descriptor~0 reading from the network and file
descriptor~1 writing to the network.  Before handling the request, the
child sets certain link:environment.html[environment variables], a la
link:sslserver.html[+sslserver+].

Each invocation of +_prog_+ handles a single request.  It is called
within a loop, with one iteration per request, and therefore must
release any resources allocated to handle a particular request.

If +_prog_+ exits while handling a request, +sslperl+ will
start a new child process.


=== CONFIGURATION
Edit the following files in +src/+ as necessary for your installation.
Unless you use modules that require +xs+ support or a nonstandard version of
perl, the defaults should suffice.

+sslperl.c+::
If your server uses a module like +DBI.pm+ you may need to add the requisite
+xs+ code.

+conf-ldperl+::
Determine options required to load +sslperl+.  By default, these are
calculated automatically.  Using +xs+ code in +src/sslperl.c+ may
require manual option setting in +src/conf-ldperl+.

+conf-ccperl+::
Determine options required to compile +sslperl+.  By default, these are
calculated automatically.

+conf-perl+::
How to invoke perl to calculate options automatically in +conf-ccperl+ and
+conf-ldperl+.
