== NAME
sslserver - listen to an SSL socket and run a command for each connection

== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
sslserver _opts_ _host_ _port_ _prog_
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION
The +sslserver+ program listens to an SSL socket on +_host_+ and +_port_+.  When
a client connects, it runs +_prog_+ with file descriptors 0 and 1 reading from
and writing to a child process. The child process attempts an SSL accept via the
network. If it succeeds, it translates data between prog and the network,
performing any necessary SSL encoding and decoding.  Before running +_prog_+,
+sslserver+ sets certain link:environment.html[environment variables].

== OPTIONS

=== GENERAL OPTIONS
+-q+::
Quiet.  Do not print error messages.

+-Q+::
(Default.)  Print error messages.

+-v+::
Verbose.  Print error messages and status messages.

=== CONNECTION OPTIONS
+-a+::
Switch user ID or group ID after reading SSL certificates.

+-A+::
(Default.) Switch user ID or group ID before reading SSL certificates.

+-b _n_+::
Allow a backlog of approximately +_n_+ pending connections.

+-B _banner_+::
Write +_banner_+ to the network immediately after each SSL connection is made.
The banner is subject to SSL translation.

+-c _n_+::
Do not handle more than +_n_+ simultaneous connections.  If there are +_n_+
simultaneous connections copies of +prog+ running, defer acceptance of a new
connection until one copy finishes.  +_n_+ must be a positive integer.  The
default value is 40.

+-d+::
Delay sending data for a fraction of a second whenever the remote host is
responding slowly.  This is currently the default, but it may not be in the
future; if you want it, set it explicitly.

+-D+::
Never delay sending data; enable +TCP_NODELAY+.

+-g _gid_+::
Switch group ID to +_gid_+ after preparing to receive connections.  NB: +_gid_+
must be a positive integer.

+-i+::
Require valid client certificates.

+-I+::
(Default.) Do not require client certificates.

+-o+::
Leave IP options alone. If the client is sending packets along an IP source
route, send packets back along the same route. 

+-O+::
(Default.) Kill IP options. A client can still use source routing to connect and
to send data, but packets will be sent back along the default route. 

+-u _uid_+::
Switch user ID to +_uid_+ after preparing to receive connections.  NB: +_uid_+
must be a positive integer.

+-U+::
Same as +-g $GID -u $UID+.  Typically, +$GID+ and +$UID+ are set by
http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/envuidgid.html[+envuidgid+].

+-x _cdb_+::
Follow the rules compiled into +_cdb_+ by
http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcprules.html[+tcprules+].  These rules may specify
setting environment variables or rejecting connections from bad sources.  You
can rerun +tcprules+ to change the rules while +sslserver+ is running.

+-X+::
With +-x _cdb_+, allow connections even if +_cdb_+ does not exist.  Normally
+sslserver+ will drop the connection if +_cdb_+ does not exist.

+-1+::
After preparing to receive connections, print the local port number to standard
output.

+-3+::
Read a null-terminated key password from file descriptor 3.

=== DATA-GATHERING OPTIONS

+-e+::
Set protocol environment a la
http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcpserver.html[+tcpserver+].  Set +$TCPLOCALIP+,
+$TCPLOCALPORT+, +$TCPLOCALHOST+, +$TCPREMOTEIP+, +$TCPREMOTEPORT+,
+$TCPREMOTEHOST+, and +$TCPREMOTEINFO+ from the corresponding +$SSL+
variables.

+-E+::
(Default.) Do not set any +tcpserver+ environment variables.

+-h+::
(Default.) Look up the remote host name in DNS to set the environment variable
+$SSLREMOTEHOST+.

+-H+::
Do not look up the remote host name in DNS; remove the environment variable
+$SSLREMOTEHOST+.  To avoid loops, you _must_ use this option for servers on
TCP port 53.

+-l _localname_+::
Do not look up the local host name in DNS; use +_localname_+ for the environment
variable +$SSLLOCALHOST+.  A common choice for +_localname_+ is 0.  To avoid
loops, you _must_ use this option for servers on TCP port 53.

+-p+::
Paranoid.  After looking up the remote host name in DNS, look up the IP
addresses in DNS for that host name, and remove the environment variable
+$SSLREMOTEHOST+ if none of the addresses match the client's IP address.

+-P+::
(Default.) Not paranoid.

+-r+::
(Default.) Attempt to obtain +$SSLREMOTEINFO+ from the remote host.

+-R+::
Do not attempt to obtain +$SSLREMOTEINFO+ from the remote host.  To avoid
loops, you _must_ use this option for servers on TCP ports 53 and 113.

+-s+::
Store client and server certificate information in the environment, a la
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html[+mod_ssl+].

+-S+::
(Default.)
Do not store client and server certificate information in the environment.

+-t _n_+::
Give up on the +$SSLREMOTEINFO+ connection attempt after +_n_+ seconds.  The
default value is: 26.

+-T _n_+::
Give up on the SSL connection attempt after +_n_+ seconds.  The default value
is: 26.

+-w _n_+::
Give up on a connection or program after waiting +_n_+ seconds for read or
write.  The default value is: 3600.

=== SSL OPTIONS
+$CADIR+::
If set, overrides the compiled-in CA directory name.  The CA directory contains
certificates files used to verify the client certificate.  This list augments
the list from +$CAFILE+.  Certificates in +$CADIR+ are processed during
certificate verification.  A server running with the +-a+ option may not be able
to read certificates in +$CADIR+.

+$CAFILE+::
If set, overrides the compiled-in CA file name.  The CA file contains the list
of CAs used to verify the client certificate.  Certificates in +$CAFILE+ are
processed when the server starts.

+$CCAFILE+::
If set, overrides the compiled-in client CA file name for client certificate
request.  The client CA file contains the list of CAs sent to the client when
requesting a client certificate.

+$CERTFILE+::
If set, overrides the compiled-in certificate file name.  The server presents
this certificate to clients.

+$CIPHERS+::
If set, override the compiled-in SSL cipher list.

+$DHFILE+::
If set, overrides the compiled-in DH parameter file name.

+$KEYFILE+::
If set, overrides the compiled-in key file name.  The key is used when loading
the server certificate.  Setting +$KEYFILE+ to the empty string instructs the
server not to use a keyfile when loading its certificate.

+$VERIFYDEPTH+::
If set, overrides the compiled-in verification depth.

== EXIT STATUS
The +sslserver+ program exits 111 for temporary errors and 100 for permanent
errors.  It exits 0 on success or when terminated by signal.

== EXAMPLES
!!!!
sslserver localhost 10443 echo \'Hello world!'
!!!!
