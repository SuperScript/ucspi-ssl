== DESCRIPTION
The +sslconnect+ program connects to +_host_+ on +_port_+ via TCP, and attempts an
SSL connection.  It sends its standard input to the server, printing a CR after
each LF, and prints any data it receives from the server to standard output.
The +sslconnect+ program does no conversion other than SSL encoding and decoding
on received data.

If +_port_+ is not supplied, +sslconnect+ uses TCP port 443 (HTTPS).

If +_host_+ is not supplied, +sslconnect+ connects uses +localhost+.

If +_args_+ are supplied, they are passed unmodified as options to +sslclient+.

== EXIT STATUS
The +sslconnect+ program exits 111 for temporary errors and 100 for permanent
errors.  It exits 0 on success.

== EXAMPLES
!!!!
echo hello | sslconnect www.example.com 1443 -l0
!!!!

If +_port_+ is not supplied, +sslconnect+ uses TCP port 443 (HTTPS).

If +_host_+ is not supplied, +sslconnect+ connects to the local host.
