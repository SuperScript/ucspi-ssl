== NAME
sslclient - connect to an SSL socket and run a command

== SYNOPSIS
!!!!
sslclient _opts_ _host_ _port_ _prog_
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION
The +sslclient+ attempts to connect to an SSL socket at +_host port_+.  If
the connection succeeds, +sslclient+ runs +_prog_+, with file descriptor
6 and 7 reading from and writing to a child process.  The child process process
attempts an SSL connect via the network.  If it succeeds, it translates data
between +_prog_+ and the network, performing any necessary SSL encoding and
decoding.  Before running +_prog_+, +sslclient+ sets certain
link:environment.html[environment variables].

== OPTIONS

=== GENERAL OPTIONS
+-q+::
Quiet.  Do not print error messages.

+-Q+::
(Default.)  Print error messages.

+-v+::
Verbose.  Print error messages and status messages.

=== CONNECTION OPTIONS
+-T _x_+_y_+::
Give up on the connection attempt or SSL connection attempt after +_x_+_y_+
seconds.  The default value is: 2+58.  When a host has several IP addresses,
+sslclient+ tries to connect to the first IP address, waits +_x_+ seconds, tries
to connect to the second IP address, waits +_x_+ seconds, etc.; then it retries
each address that timed out, waiting +_y_+ seconds per address.  You may omit
++_y_+ to skip the second try.

+-i _localip_+::
Use +_localip_+ as the IP address for the local side of the connection; quit if
+_localip_+ is not available.  Normally +sslclient+ lets the operating system
choose an address.

+-p _localport_+::
Use +_localport_+ as the TCP port for the local side of the connection; quit if
+_localport_+ is not available.  Normally +sslclient+ lets the operating system
choose a port.

+-d+::
Delay sending data for a fraction of a second whenever the remote host is
responding slowly.  This is currently the default, but it may not be in the
future; if you want it, set it explicitly.

+-D+::
Never delay sending data; enable +TCP_NODELAY+.

+-3+::
Read a null-terminated key password from file descriptor 3.

+-a _cafile_+::
Override the compiled-in CA file name.  The CA file contains the list of CAs
used to verify the server certificate.

+-A _cadir_+::
Override the compiled-in CA directory name.  The CA directory contains
certificates files used to verify the client certificate.  This list augments
the list from +-a _cafile_+.

+-c _certfile_+::
Use the client certificate in +_certfile_+.

+-k _keyfile_+::
Use the client certificate key in +_keyfile_+.

+-V _verifydepth_+::
Verify the server certificate chain to depth +_verifydepth_+.  The default value
is 1.

+-C _ciphers_+::
Use the cipher list specified in +_ciphers_+.

+-x+::
(Default.) Verify the server certificate.

+-X+::
Do not verify the server certificate.

=== DATA-GATHERING OPTIONS
+-h+::
(Default.) Look up the remote host name in DNS to set the environment variable
+$SSLREMOTEHOST+.

+-H+::
Do not look up the remote host name in DNS; remove the environment variable
+$SSLREMOTEHOST+.

+-n+::
(Default.) Verify that the server host name matches the server certificate
common name.

+-N+::
Do not verify that the server host name matches the server certificate common
name.

+-l _localname_+::
Do not look up the local host name in DNS; use +_localname_+ for the environment
variable +$SSLLOCALHOST+.  A common choice for +_localname_+ is 0.

+-r+::
(Default.) Attempt to obtain +$SSLREMOTEINFO+ from the remote host.

+-R+::
Do not attempt to obtain +$SSLREMOTEINFO+ from the remote host.

+-t _n_+::
Give up on the +$SSLREMOTEINFO+ connection attempt after +_n_+ seconds.  The
default value is: 26.

+-w _n_+::
Give up on a connection or program after waiting +_n_+ seconds for read or
write.  The default value is: 3600.

+-s+::
Store client and server certificate information in the environment, a la
http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/mod_ssl.html[+mod_ssl+].

+-S+::
(Default.) Do not store client and server certificate information in the
environment.

+-e+::
Set protocol environment a la
http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp/tcpserver.html[+tcpserver+].  Set +$TCPLOCALIP+,
+$TCPLOCALPORT+, +$TCPLOCALHOST+, +$TCPREMOTEIP+, +$TCPREMOTEPORT+,
+$TCPREMOTEHOST+, and +$TCPREMOTEINFO+ from the corresponding +$SSL+
variables.

+-E+::
(Default.) Do not set any +tcpserver+ environment variables.

== EXIT STATUS
The +sslclient+ program exits 111 for temporary errors and 100 for permanent
errors.  It exits 0 on success.

== EXAMPLES
!!!!
sslserver localhost 10443 sh -c '
  cat >&7
  exec cat <&6
'
