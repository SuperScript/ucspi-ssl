Development of the ucspi-ssl package has stalled here at its original home.
Fortunately others have stepped in to continue development and improve upon what
came before.  Please refer to the <<sources,Related Software>> links below.

== What Is ucspi-ssl?
The ucspi-ssl package contains tools for building client-server applications
using SSL sockets.  They conform to the UNIX Client-Server Program Interface,
http://cr.yp.to/proto/ucspi.txt[UCSPI].

== Features
The +sslserver+ program listens for connections on an SSL socket and runs a
program for each connection it accepts.  The program environment includes
variables that hold the local and remote host names, IP addresses, and port
numbers. The +sslserver+ program can limit concurrency and provide selective
handling of connections based on client identity.

The +sslclient+ program requests a connection to a TCP socket, and runs a
program.  The program environment includes the same variables as for
+sslserver+.
